                Urine from cows has a high concentration of nitrates from the grass which they eat as farmers use nitrate fertilisers to make the grass grow faster. As cow paddocks are close to rivers and streams urine from the cows leak into them from the ground or cows in unfenced paddocks swim and urinate in them. The nitrogen causes toxic algae to grow in the rivers making them unsafe for people to swim in and drink.

                Organisations such as Living Water help protect New Zealand waters through projects. Living Water is Fonterra and DOC, Department of Conservation, working together to help rivers and farmers thrive while reducing harmful effects on the environment. Examples of projects which they are doing are creating water purifiers by lakes, restoring the Selwyn river, and stopping companies from ruining the environment when building structures.
