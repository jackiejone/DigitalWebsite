            Tourism New Zealand markets New Zealand as being “100% Pure”, however, this statement is false. An example of why we are not as 'pure' as we should be is due to our rivers, streams and lakes caused by pollution, contamination, and weeds. Some rivers around the Canterbury region which are affected by this are the Selwyn and the Waimakariri River.
