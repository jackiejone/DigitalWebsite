            Tourism New Zealand markets New Zealand as being “100% Pure”, however this statement is false.
            An example of why we are not as 'pure' as we should be is due to our rivers, streams and lakes caused by
            pollution, contamination, over fishing, and weeds. Some rivers around the Canterbury region which are affected by this are
            Selwyn, Avon, and the Waimakariri River.
